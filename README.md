## Hi!

I'm an NLP specialist: I combine my background in linguistics with data science tools and a decade of experience in programming. You can find some of my past projects here:
- UK Political Speech Classifier: 7-way classification of UK parliamentary speeches by party. You can find the backend (Pyhton package with dockerized FastAPI) [here](https://github.com/szaboildi/uk-pol-speech-classifier) and the frontend [here](https://github.com/szaboildi/uk-pol-speech-classifier-frontend).
- Accommodation model: Computational simulation the phonetic accommodation (imitation) process happening in natural language conversations ([Python codebase](https://github.com/szaboildi/accommodation-model))
- Transcribed Corpus Tools: A [Python toolkit](https://github.com/szaboildi/transcribed-corpus-tools) for creating and analyzing phonological corpora
